How to play
Players selection
You need to insert the player that goes first X or O players.

Human versus Human.
If two human players start to play, you just need to
 click in an empty position in the grid to display (X or O).  

Human versus Computer.
click on button ,If you want to play with computer ,  If it is your turn, 
just click in the position you want to play in the grid. After that the computer will perform its move. 

 win counter:
 if a players win , their score  increase

Game over:
If a player forms a row, a column or a diagonal with same letter player wins and the game ends. 
If the grid is full and thereâ€™s no row, column or diagonal of the same letter,the game ends at draw. 

Once the game has a winner or a draw, you will see a dialog informing about the result. 
if you want to play again just click on reset button .



List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations :

When play with a computer, the score of winner increase twice.



Describe how you solved for the winner :

I used forEach() method executes a provided function once each element of an a correctValue array.
the function checks if  row or vertical line or  diagonal have a same letter ("XXX","OOO")
you will see a dialog informing about whose the winner, and the counter of score increase automaticly



It was fun and very challenging to me as this is the first time to build an game application
